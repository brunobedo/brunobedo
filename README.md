I'm <b>Bruno Bedo</b> (@brunobedo).üëã <br>

I have B.Sc. in Physical Education and Sport at the School of Physical Education and Sport of Ribeir√£o Preto, University of S√£o Paulo, M.Sc (2016, Brazil) and Ph.D. (2021, Brazil).
During the PhD degree, I had worked as a researcher at Human Movement Biomechanics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa (2019, Canada). 
I has developed research on sports biomechanics, human movement, motor control and data science applied to sports.
Also, I have knowledge in programming languages focused on data acquisition, analysis and interpretation of sports data. 
Currently I have been working as a Data Scientist at Grupo Globo, analyzing sports data, mainly related to the game fantasy Cartola FC
